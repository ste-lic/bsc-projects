# Tools and Resources

For the development of this video game, we will use **Unity**. This software serves as an IDE and includes the following tools:
- A graphics engine, which is the software core of a video game or any other application with real-time graphics. The basic functionalities typically provided by a graphics engine include a rendering engine ("renderer") for 2D and 3D graphics, a physics engine or collision detector, sound, scripting, animations, artificial intelligence, networking, and scene-graph.
- Various windows depending on the functionalities, which speed up the development and testing phases of the product.

During the development of the video game, free assets from Unity's official Asset Store were used. For coding the scripts, we used Microsoft Visual Studio Community, a free release supported by Unity.

# Development Stages

## The Underlying Idea

The idea for this video game is inspired by **Super Mario Land (1990)** and **Bubble Bobble (1986)**, both of which are childhood favorites. Super Mario Land is a 2D side-scrolling platformer, while Bubble Bobble is a pure platformer. Our developed video game features a fixed-screen level where the player must collect all the coins without dying to progress.

## Feature Specification

The following concepts are drawn from the two aforementioned games:
- Horizontal movement and single vertical jump.
- Collection of objects to score points, reflecting the arcade origins of the reference games, where score-based rankings were created at the end of the game.
- Fixed-screen levels populated with stationary obstacles (the fixed-screen level is characteristic of Bubble Bobble, while the stationary obstacles are characteristic of Super Mario).
